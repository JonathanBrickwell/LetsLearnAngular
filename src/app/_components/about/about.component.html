    <p>First things first, I'm not an ambassador of <b>Angular</b>. Honestly, I've only started profesionally working in it almost a year ago, but its benefits are already undeniable.</p>
    <p>My desired tech stack for years was <b>vanilla js</b>, <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>. After awhile, <b>PHP</b> & <b>.NET</b> came along and I fell in love with the <b>MVC</b> patterns approach!</p>
    <p>As javascript frameworks like <b>Angular</b>, <b>React</b> & <b>Vue</b> started creeping around the corner, I remained cautious and observed from afar. That changed rapidly once I was employed and had to work as an Angular developer...what a ride.</p>
